Beers Case Study Repo

R markdown file contains all of the information neccessary for a complete rundown of the needed requirements from the CEO of Budweiser. Along with the md file there is also the initial code that is used before converted over to the rm file. The initial code is stored in the "Normal R Markdown" file structure. It is an added bonus for the thought process of this project.

Additionally, the knitted HTML file is also available to view for a clean, readable, and presentable document. Powerpoint presentation for the EDA, YouTube presentation links, and CSV files added to separate folders.
